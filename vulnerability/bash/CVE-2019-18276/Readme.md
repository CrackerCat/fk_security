## introduction
	Bash 5.0 patch 11及之前版本中的shell.c文件的disable_priv_mode存在安全漏洞。攻击者可利用该漏洞获取权限。
	By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID,
	it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID.
	However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support "saved UID" functionality,
	the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use "enable -f" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.
